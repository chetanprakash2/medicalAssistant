# ðŸ©º MedChat AI

A conversational medical assistant that provides basic suggestions based on symptoms entered in *English* and *Hinglish*. It's built using LLMs (OpenAI API), vector search (FAISS), and LangChain, all wrapped in a Streamlit interface.

The goal: to help users get preliminary medical insights without needing an immediate doctor visit, especially for common symptoms.
